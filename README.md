# A-Whispered-Echo
In memory of Hytale, I tried to bring back the impression it left on me and its overall atmosphere. The goal of this modpack isn't to replicate the game's content, but to echo the way it made me feel.

I hope it will also leave you with that sense of wonder and adventure.

I did not use any content from the actual game, such as music, textures, lore, or anything else.

The modpack's vibe comes mostly from the resource pack used (Whimscape), the custom settings of the integrated shaderpack (Complementary Reimagined), and the whimsical music from the Reactive Music mod. That's why I strongly advise against playing without these, as you would lose most of the charm.
